                <p>Hello! I’m Shifa Faisal, a Networking IT and Security student with Pakistani roots who is passionate about cybersecurity. 
                I enjoy being creative through coding with Python and working on networking and IT skills. 
                In my free time, I like photography and video editing because they let me express myself in different ways. 
                I’m excited to keep learning and growing in both technology and creativity. 
                Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out if you have any questions or opportunities!</p>
